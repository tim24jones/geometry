# geometry

A logical framework for creating and understanding the relationship between geometrical objects.

Motivation: To be able to automatically create geometrical problems based on these logical interdependencies, ideally automatically generating a bunch of problems (and their answers) to help with practice.

What this is not:
A program for drawing pretty shapes, like geogebra or kig, so this will probably have limited appeal.

Based on the Euclidean system, at least initially.
